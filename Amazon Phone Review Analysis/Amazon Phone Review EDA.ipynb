    "So, imagine this: you are on the hunt for a new smartphone, scrolling through Amazon's endless array of options. You're not just interested in what the specs say or what the manufacturers claim ‚Äì you want to know what real users have to say. That's where the magic of customer reviews comes in!\n",
    "\n",
    "Think about it, every review is a goldmine of insights waiting to be discovered. Are the users raving about the camera quality? or are they complaining about the battery life? Or perhaps, there is a hidden feature that no one is talking about (this is prevalent in our world as we really do not have the time to dig through the hooks and crannies of our smart phones). \n",
    "\n",
    "This project will dive into the world of Amazon phone reviews using python to unravel trends and  patterns through exploratory data analysis. We will engage in some data cleaning and wrangling, data exploration and answer some questions that can perhaps allow you to find your next dream phone üòÅ. The data used in this project was sourced from data world. You can view the full dataset [here](https://data.world/opensnippets/amazon-mobile-phones-reviews).\n",
    "Below are some questions that will be answered:\n",
    "\n",
    "1- What are the top 5 most reviewed phones on Amazon?\n",
    "\n",
    "2- Which phone has the highest average review rating?\n",
    "\n",
    "3- What percentage of reviews are verified purchases?\n",
    "\n",
    "4- Is there a correlation between helpful_count and review_rating?\n",
    "\n",
    "5- How does the distribution of review ratings vary across different phone brands?\n",
    "\n",
    "6- What are the most commonly mentioned colors for phones in the reviews?\n",
    "\n",
    "7- Are there any trends in the frequency of reviews over time?\n",
    "\n",
    "8- Which sub-category of phones (e.g., \"Smartphones,\" \"Android Phones,\" \"iPhones\") receives the most positive reviews?\n",
    "\n",
    "9- Do certain product features or styles correlate with higher review ratings?\n",
    "\n",
    "10- Are there any differences in review sentiment between different countries or regions?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
